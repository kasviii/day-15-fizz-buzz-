FizzBuzz repository
Imagine counting from 1 to 100, but with a few twists: If a number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by 5, say "Buzz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz"!

The Code Loops: The code uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100.
Conditional statements: It uses if statements to check for divisibility by 3 and 5, and print the appropriate output.
Modulo operator: The % (modulo) operator is used to check for remainders after division, a handy trick for divisibility checks.
